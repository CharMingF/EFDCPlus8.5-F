C44 TOXIC SORPTION OPTION, DIFFUSION AND MIXING
*
*    NTOXN: TOXIC CONTAMINANT NUMBER ID (1 LINE OF DATA BY DEFAULT)
*    ISTOC: 0 INORGANIC SOLIDS BASED PARTITIONING ONLY (Kd APPROACH)
*           1 FOR DISS AND PART ORGANIC CARBON SORPTION, POC IS SPECIFIED
*           2 FOR DISS ORGANIC CARBON SORPTION AND POC FRACTIONALLY
*             DISTRIBUTED TO INORGANIC SEDIMENT CLASSES
*           3 FOR NO DISS ORGANIC CARBON SORPTION AND POC FRACTIONALLY
*             DISTRIBUTED TO INORGANIC SEDIMENT CLASSES
*   DIFTOX:   DIFFUSION COEFF FOR TOXICANT IN SED BED PORE WATER (M^2/s)
*   DIFTOXS:  DIFFUSION COEFF FOR TOXICANT BETWEEN WATER COLUMN AND
*              PORE WATER IN TOP LAYER OF THE BED(M^2/s)
*              > 0.0 INTERPRET AS DIFFUSION COEFFICIENT (M^2/s)
*              < 0.0 INTERPRET AS FLUX VELOCITY (m/s)
*   PDIFTOX:  PARTICLE MIXING DIFFUSION COEFF FOR TOXICANT IN SED BED (M^2/s)
*             (if negative use zonal files PARTMIX.INP and PMXMAP.INP)
*   DPDIFTOX: DEPTH IN BED OVER WHICH PARTICLE MIXING IS ACTIVE (m)
