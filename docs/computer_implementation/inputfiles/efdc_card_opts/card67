C67 DRIFTER DATA (FIRST 4 PARAMETERS FOR SUB DRIFTER, SECOND 6 FOR SUB LAGRANGIAN)
*
*  ISPD:   1 TO ACTIVE SIMULTANEOUS RELEASE AND LAGRANGIAN TRANSPORT OF
*            NEUTRALLY BUOYANT PARTICLE DRIFTERS AT LOCATIONS INPUT ON C68
*          2 TO ACTIVATE DS-INTERNATIONAL'S LPT DRIFTER COMPUTATIONS (DRIFTER.INP)
*  NPD:      NUMBER OF PARTICLE DRIFTERS
*  NPDRT:    TIME STEP AT WHICH PARTICLES ARE RELEASED
*  NWPD:     NUMBER OF TIME STEPS BETWEEN WRITING TO TRACKING FILE
*            DRIFTER.OUT
*  ISLRPD: 1 TO ACTIVATE CALCULATION OF LAGRANGIAN MEAN VELOCITY OVER TIME
