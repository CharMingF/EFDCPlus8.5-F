   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.
   
.. Normally, there are no heading levels assigned to certain characters as the structure is determined from the succession of headings. However, for the Python documentation, here is a suggested convention:

.. # with overline, for parts
.. * with overline, for chapters
.. =, for sections
.. -, for subsections
.. ^, for subsubsections
.. ", for paragraphs
