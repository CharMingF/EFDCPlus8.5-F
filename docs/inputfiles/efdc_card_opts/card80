C80 CONTROLS FOR 3D FIELD OUTPUT
*
*  IS3DO:  1 TO WRITE TO 3D ASCII INTEGER FORMAT FILES, JS3DVAR.LE.2     SEE|
*          1 TO WRITE TO 3D ASCII FLOAT POINT FORMAT FILES, JS3DVAR.EQ.3 C57|
*          2 TO WRITE TO 3D CHARACTER ARRAY FORMAT FILES (NOT ACTIVE)
*          3 TO WRITE TO 3D HDF IMAGE FORMAT FILES (NOT ACTIVE)
*          4 TO WRITE TO 3D HDF FLOATING POINT FORMAT FILES (NOT ACTIVE)
*  ISR3DO:   SAME AS IS3DO EXCEPT FOR RESIDUAL VARIABLES
*  NP3DO:    NUMBER OF WRITES PER LAST REF TIME PERIOD FOR INST VARIABLES
*  KPC:      NUMBER OF UNSTRETCHED PHYSICAL VERTICAL LAYERS
*  NWGG:     IF NWGG IS GREATER THAN ZERO, NWGG DEFINES THE NUMBER OF !2877|
*            WATER CELLS IN CARTESIAN 3D GRAPHICS GRID OVERLAY OF THE
*            CURVILINEAR GRID. FOR NWGG>0 AND EFDC RUNS ON A CURVILINEAR
*            GRID, I3DMI,I3DMA,J3DMI,J3DMA REFER TO CELL INDICES ON THE
*            ON THE CARTESIAN GRAPHICS GRID OVERLAY DEFINED BY FILE
*            GCELL.INP.  THE FILE GCELL.INP IS NOT USED BY EFDC, BUT BY
*            THE COMPANION GRID GENERATION CODE GEFDC.F.  INFORMATION
*            DEFINING THE OVERLAY IS READ BY EFDC.F FROM THE FILE
*            GCELLMP.INP. IF NWGG EQUALS 0, I3DMI,I3DMA,J3DMI,J3DMA REFER
*            TO INDICES ON THE EFDC GRID DEFINED BY CELL.INP.
*            ACTIVATION OF THE REWRITE OPTION I3DRW=1 WRITES TO THE FULL
*            GRID DEFINED BY CELL.INP AS IF CELL.INP DEFINES A CARTESIAN
*            GRID.  IF NWGG EQ 0 AND THE EFDC COMP GRID IS CO, THE REWRITE
*            OPTION IS NOT RECOMMENDED AND A POST PROCESSOR SHOULD BE USED
*            TO TRANSFER THE SHORT FORM, I3DRW=0, OUTPUT TO AN APPROPRIATE
*            FORMAT FOR VISUALIZATION. CONTACT DEVELOPER FOR MORE DETAILS
*  I3DMI:    MINIMUM OR BEGINNING I INDEX FOR 3D ARRAY OUTPUT
*  I3DMA:    MAXIMUM OR ENDING I INDEX FOR 3D ARRAY OUTPUT
*  J3DMI:    MINIMUM OR BEGINNING J INDEX FOR 3D ARRAY OUTPUT
*  J3DMA:    MAXIMUM OR ENDING J INDEX FOR 3D ARRAY OUTPUT
*  I3DRW:  0 FILES WRITTEN FOR ACTIVE CO WATER CELLS ONLY
*          1 REWRITE FILES TO CORRECT ORIENTATION DEFINED BY GCELL.INP
*            AND GCELLMP.INP FOR CO WITH NWGG.GT.O OR BY CELL.INP IF THE
*            COMPUTATIONAL GRID IS CARTESIAN AND NWGG.EQ.0
*  SELVMAX:  MAXIMUM SURFACE ELEVATION FOR UNSTRETCHING (ABOVE MAX SELV )
*  BELVMIN:  MINIMUM BOTTOM ELEVATION FOR UNSTRETCHING (BELOW MIN BELV)
