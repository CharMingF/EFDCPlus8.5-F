Square Harbor Test Case 
=======================


A sample model, referred to as the `Square Harbor`, taken from [Bijvelds1999]_ is provided.

The model has 2,782 horizontal grid cells and 10 vertical layers

Information about the model can be found in the following folders.

- ``SquareHarbor\Data``: This folder contains data that can be used with the model. These data can be measured data or output from model or derived from analytical equations.  

- ``SquareHarbor\Model``: EFDC model that can be run.

**Disclaimer**: The model is provided to our users to demonstrate that EFDC_Explorer and EFDC+ can be used to accurately represent models in the literature. The measured data provided in the data folder can be used to compare the U and V components of velocity from the model. The model is running fine with reasonable agreement to measured velocity.
