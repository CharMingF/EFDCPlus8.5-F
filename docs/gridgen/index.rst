Cartesian Grid Generator User Guide
===================================

A simple GUI has been provided to help generate and visualize EFDC+ grids.  Additionally, this grid generator can write out the basic input file necessary for running EFDC+.  Next, an overview of how to use this grid generator will be provided. 


To launch the grid generator open the ``GridGenerator.exe`` executable under the folder ``GridGenerator``.

The interface of the tool is shown in Figure 1. To create a grid, the
