Ohio River Test Case
====================


A complete model is given which simulates the hydrodynamics in the Ohio River. This model can be found in ``SampleModels\Ohio_River_4``. In addition to hydrodynamics, the dye module is used to simulate pulses into the Ohio River from Mill Creek in Cincinnati.


In the model there are 510 horizontal grid cells and 1 and 4 vertical layers.  An overview of the grid is provided in the figure below.
